Water Supply,Negative,No water tankers it seems and there‚Äôs no water today in a premium gated A builder society.
Water Supply,Negative,"Absolutely no water problems in our area in South Bangalore. We have never needed tanker water, not even at the height of this past summer's water crisis. We get enough Kaveri water and our bore well water is adequate."
Water Supply,Negative,Water crisis? Absolutely alien concept in Basavanagudi
Water Supply,Negative,"It‚Äôs not even the end of the monsoon , and you are already suffering a water crisis..
The society didnt plan well for getting water tankers beforehand? Water crisis is a reality in all cities, not only in Bangalore. In our society, we faced water crisis during peak summer this year, so the association is calling water tankers from summer and we are still comtinuing to use water tankers to make sure, the tankers will be available for the peak summer next year. Even though, our borewell has water now."
Water Supply,Negative,Theres water shortage and water has too much bleach
Water Supply,Negative,"The water supplied is hard water, it is ruining peoples hair and skin health. The bathrooms are gettting this white layer also."

Water Supply,Negative,We are also suffering from water shortage since one week there is no water supply in the diLShad garden .delhi jal board destroy our festive season
Water Supply,Negative,Agreed. We are better. Now can we talk or discuss things where we significantly lack?? How bad is our urban infrastructure & planning is? How bad our waste management is?? (We are dirtiest big state in India). We have water supply issues. R we gonna discuss these ever?

Water Supply,Negative,"Very little rain, recent scorching temperatures and a late monsoon season are being blamed for the water shortage in India's sixth-largest city, with nearly 5 million residents."
Water Supply,Negative,"Water level in more than half of India's major reservoirs is below 40%.

Have shared many times earlier why I feel that our push towards water guzzling crops and chemicals will face this water table issue. And hence why one should have waste water treatment stocks in portfolio."
Water Supply,Negative,"Absolutely frightening! It says 40% of India will have no access to drinking water by 2030. 21 cities will run out of ground water by next year, yes by next year if govt doesn‚Äôt wake up and undertake efficient water-management techniques."
Water Supply,Positive,"And our PM has said today that he is happy that people are becoming aware of the water crisis...good that atleast thru the people, he is also now aware....now he will smartly transfer the onus for water conservation on the people from the govt..like he did in swachh bharat"
Water Supply,Negative,"Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Madras. They are all running out of groundwater. Most lower middle class communities only get water for a hour twice a week. People queuing for water is a very common site- everyday.
Maybe that condescending attitude can be toned down a bit?"

They will simply make the govt pay for supplying them much larger quantity of Bisleri bottled water than is allotted to them on normal days!

""Among the affected neighbourhoods include Jor Bagh, Lodhi Colony, Golf Links, Pandara Road, the High Court vicinity, East and West Kidwai Nagar, Tughlaq Crescent, Ravinder Nagar, Khan Market, Lodhi Estate, Akbar Road, Amrita Shergill Marg, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Road, Prithvi Raj Road, and Tees January Road, among others."""
Water Supply,Positive,I see many who have an excuse for any comparison. No state/city/town in India would compare in basics like 24 hr Clean pipe water/Walkable streets/Efficient garbage disposal/24 hr power supply. These are fundamental things most citizens in middle income countries enjoy.
Water Supply,Positive,"#JalJeevanMission has significantly improved access to potable water in rural India, with 78.58% of rural households now benefiting from clean water supply. Positively impacting 19 crore rural families, govt has installed 11.95 crore new tap water connections."
Water Supply,Negative,"Because water supply isn't reliable in most parts of India. In a top loader you have the flexibility to stop the cycle, open the lid and wash some clothes by hand.

Front load shuts down when water supply is interrupted.

Same reason for low dishwasher sales too."
Water Supply,Negative,"India‚Äôs ground water, once plentiful, is now a cause for serious concern as it retreats to the lowest levels known. 90% of rural India‚Äôs drinking water and 75% of our agriculture depends on ground water. "
Water Supply,Negative,"What Bangalore is facing today (and in coming summers) was faced by us in Rajasthan 15 years ago. Water supply once a week, taking bath with half bucket. Shower was out of the question. There were not even tanker mafias to rely upon. Hand-pumps were dry.

And many cities will face a similar situation in the coming years. Managing and supplying clean, fresh water to every house will become the most challenging part of authorities. 

You might be trying to save water at your end by switching off the tap on time, just like how you try to save the environment by using paper straws, but the tanker mafia and the cartel will decide what kind and when do you get the fresh water in your taps. This is because wherever you are, the government is weak. (or probably corrupt) . 

The rivers are dying, and dirty, borewells are drying, rain water harvesting is in theory only."
Water Supply,Positive,"But today's situation in Rajasthan is commendable, atleast in rural Rajasthan. They are storing water in ""Houd"" and using it over the period of time. Once or twice a week they get tap water for 3-4 hours, so they refill it."
Water Supply,Positive,"Rajasthan learned it in the hard way. I am in Pune for 12 years but because of my Rajasthan childhood I still feel guilty using more than half a bucket to bathe. 

But for metro cities, it will be very difficult to learn."
Water Supply,,"Hyderabad supply the most amount of water in South India. In last 15 yrs, they created multiple source of water. City can get water from its traditional sources like Osman and Himayat sagar, Manjira dam, Godavari, and Nagarjunasagar (Krishna - underconstruction)"
Water Supply,Negative,"Despite being known as a water surplus state, Bihar is grappling with a severe water crisis... Even though summer hasn't reached its peak yet, State's water future is alarming...

5 out of 23 reservoirs are already empty. 
16 have barely any water left (<10% capacity.)

River conditions even worse... Over 40 having dried up entirely. Water levels in the remaining rivers have significantly declined. 

Hand pumps and borings are failing due to dropping groundwater levels. The water table in my area has dropped significantly.... It used to be just 20 ft deep a few decades back."
Water Supply,Negative,"Bengaluru is facing severe water scarcity due to drought. As borewells drying up, water tanker prices soared. Govt plans to use milk tankers for water transport and seize private borewells. Situation is BAD !"
Water Supply,Negative,"Even pregnant women are forced to walk for 5-8 hrs everyday to get drinking water in Tikuri Village in Bundelkhand.
The wells, borewells & hand-pumps have all run dry in the extreme heat.
""When kids cry in the middle of night we give them contaminated water, what else can we do?"""
Water Supply,Negative," if roads/highways are shiny side of the Indian economy, rural distress is the story not being told enough. We travelled just 50 kms outside Baramati and found that water scarcity is a serious crisis: water comes once in eight days here!. Even the monies farmers get from various cash hand outs from govt are being used up for higher input costs for farming. Here, the villagers told us they don‚Äôt trust ‚ÄòModi ki guarantee‚Äô or any opposition politician‚Äôs promise until they deliver on water. . ‚ÄòThey only show up at election time,‚Äô they tell us. Several parts of rural Maharashtra have experienced drought like conditions in the past year as private tankers dot the countryside."
Water Supply,Negative,"Water supply is better these days in bengaluru. But water, as always is leading to hairfall and dry skin."
Water Supply,Negative,"The worst thing about paying taxes in India is that you still have to drive on broken roads, deal with hard water and water logging issues, and receive subpar education. Why would the top 1% want to stay here?"
Roads,Negative,"Death from road accident is higher than death from medical conditions in India, many lives lost due to immediate support. Addressing this issue Dr Saint MSG Insan initiated #FasterCampaign. Through this initiative, millions are started to carry first aid kits in their vehicles. But also, the govt needs to take action on building better roads and engineers should design the road system so that less accidents take place"
Roads,Negative,"This is what you get after paying the highest road tax in India.

Roads,Negative,"Stretches along Dahisar-Borivali, Kandivali, Goregaon are in worst conditions and no one bothers."
Roads,Negative,Just travelled on link road from Malad to Borivali last night. Entire Link Road stretch is in a dire state. God knows when and how good sense wil prevail amongst the authorities. 
Roads,Negative,Every second road in Mumbai is unwalkable and undrivable during the monsoon season. Year after year after year. In the financial capital of the country hosting the biggest corporate houses. With the richest municipal corporation in Asia administering it. Zero accountability.
Roads,Negative,"Indian roads are extremely terrible and poorly planned. They are severely affected by the traffic of present-day cars and vehicles.

The government cannot and should not reduce taxes on vehicles until they make roads capable of handling the high capacity."
Roads,Negative,"We need a massive public protest against toll tax extortion by Govt. They provide worst quality of National Highways. Roads are full of potholes and accident-prone. Lack of signboards and dangerous diversions. During Monsoon, one finds it tough to spot these potholes at night."
Roads,Negative,"Totally agree, they are just interested in collecting tolls and not doing maintenance of existing roads. New highways that are being constructed are also of very inferior quality."
Roads,Negative,"Just how bad and I seriously mean it, how bad is the infra situation in Mumbai? The Ganpatrao Kadam road (At Worli Naka) was dug up for 6 months for some work. The road just opened for public and within 2 weeks has massive potholes. Just unimaginable level of corruption"
Roads,Negative,"I hope someone is looking into pathetic condition of Mumbai-Ahmedabad Highway (NH8).. Took me 11 hours to travel 300kms from Mumbai to Gujarat.. RCC road work being done is of worst ever quality, hardly 30-40kms stretch on entire route without potholes"
Roads,Negative,Average vehicle speed was 30-40kmph due to condition of roads.. 31st century quality of construction.. I think 19th century quality of construction was way better where we travelled 300kms in 6 hours. Businesses getting impacted by double engine govt. Just take tax and dont do any work
Roads,Negative,"I have been to many state capitals in India in the last few months including Bhubaneshwar, Lucknow, Ranchi, Kolkata, & Trivandrum. But Mumbai has the worst roads of all. 

Huge potholes, invisible because of rain water, are a health and life hazard currently. But no one cares."
Roads,Negative,The traffic junction where Juhu-Tara road meets Santacruz linking road has at least 10 huge potholes - and then the Linking road towards Bandra has half-foot deep craters. And this is the supposedly-posh area of Mumbai.
Roads,Negative,"I invite you to state highways in Maharashtra. 
Took that in sept 22- dhapoli to bby..more potholes than roads. Potholes so big that trucks were stuck in them.

Is it that only highways in Maharashtra by NHAI are bad? Or other states too?

Roads,Negative,And Chennai. So many roads cut and made one vazhi. No amount of complaining is helping. Look at these huge potholes on main Greenways Road to beach. It‚Äôs been like this since the last rains. All vehicles slow down dangerously on the curve to avoid damaging their vehicles or worse falling. Two places - one near Ayappan Koil Bus Stop and one near Karpagam Avenue - MRC Nagar junction. They are so poor they can‚Äôt mend it after milling a patch and levelling it with tar?
Roads,Negative,"Corruption is the main reason for bad roads in India.

Only 30-40% of the project cost is actually spent on the ground and rest all goes into the pockets of various people. So, nothing better can be expected."
Roads,Negative,"India is building some of the worst highways in the world

A large pit collapsed in the road service lane near Dharjodi settlement on Friday evening, including a nursing student fell a scooty and suffered serious injuries to her hands and legs. 

The road was inaugurated by Chief Minister Hemant Soren on October 4, but there are road collapse incidents happening everywhere.

Sanjay Kumar, DGM of Saj Company, engaged in construction of 8 lane road, said that the reason for road collapse was leakage in the rising pipeline, causing soil cut. Service lane repairs will begin Saturday."
Roads,Positive,"Shocked to witness the quality of roads in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.

Roads,Negative,"The condition of Roads across WB is so bad that the stress levels of the commuters are skyrocketing. All over the State, the bumpy roads are adding to the agony of the passengers & drivers. The  pothole riddled roads stir up ""Bowls of Dust' when vehicles ply on them. The dust ends up in the lungs of the drivers, passengers, pedestrians, Traffic Police personnel, Civic Volunteers, shopkeepers & other people who happen to be nearby. The shops adjacent to the roads get filled with dirt.
Any commute takes up double the time as slow movement of traffic leads to congestion. Vehicles; both private & commercial, get damaged constantly due to the pathetic road conditions.

Usually, the State Govt and the local Administration used to repair the roads before Durga Puja, but this time around the cash scrapped & bankrupt WB Govt couldn't even manage to do that. Even the Contractors are wary of taking up the repair works, as they haven't been paid in the last 2-3 years. 

The people of Bengal would have to suffer the consequences and their festive spirit would turn sour once they hit the streets for Pandal hopping.

With the mountains reeling under natural calamities; tourists who were planning to go on ""Off Roading"" adventure journeys, can enjoy the thrills on the roads of WB. These roads would surely pump up the adrenaline of the thrill seekers."
Roads,Negative,"Currently, this is the unfortunate state of roads in a city as advanced and cosmopolitan as Bangalore. The stretch that connects Sarjapur Main Road to Electronic City Phase 2‚Äîa critical link for commuters and tech professionals‚Äîis plagued with potholes and craters, making it a hazard rather than a convenience. Many people prefer this route to save time, given Bangalore's notorious traffic, yet they are forced to navigate through rough patches that damage vehicles, endanger lives, and slow down daily commutes.

In a city that prides itself on being India‚Äôs IT hub and aspires to compete on the global stage, this level of road neglect is not only disappointing but also dangerous. Residents are left wondering what to expect from the government, which promotes the city as a brand of progress and innovation. Is this the reality behind the ""Brand Bengaluru"" image‚Äîa city with roads so poorly maintained that they appear more like neglected rural trails than infrastructure befitting a modern metropolis? The ongoing issue of potholes and craters has become symbolic of the authorities' inability to provide even the most basic amenities despite years of promises for improvement. It raises serious concerns about accountability and the actual commitment towards creating a city that prioritizes the safety and well-being of its citizens.

The people of Bangalore deserve roads that are safe, efficient, and worthy of the city's status, not ones that put them in harm's way."

bridges,Negative,"20+ bridges have fallen in Bihar. The tax payers money is obnoxiously divided among Netas, Babus, Police and Thekedars. If Bihar is serious about special status, it should first take money out of the stakeholders who are responsible for collapse of 20 bridges."
bridges,Negative,"A part of under construction bridge collapsed in Kashi - This is the Kyoto Modi promised.

Stampede on footover bridge in Mumbai - they have money to build Shivaji statue but not a good bridge.

3rd bridge collapsed in Kolkata - please don't do politics in this."
bridges,Negative,"Bridge in West bengal collapses, no news
Bridge in Karnataka collapses, no news
Bridge in Andheri,Maharashtra collapses,everyone notices."
bridges,Negative,"I have read of 12 bridges collapsing in Bihar, one just now in Uttarakhand and let‚Äôs not forget the Morbi bridge collapse in Gujarat some years ago. There is obviously huge corruption in construction, poor material used, builder nexus with politicians, a flawed tender system, poor bureaucratic oversight on safety norms. Just a rotten corrupt system."
bridges,Negative,"Year after year and decades after decade, Bihar remains so poor and under-developed. A 1700 crore bridge collapses. Just like that. That too for the second time. Bihari ppl are known for constructing some great structures across nation and at local level this happens? Material used and intent of the contractor is highly questionable. Where is the money going?"

Hope the Railway authorities wake up.

railways,Negative,This is one of the most important railway terminal in India.It is a disgust to India.Waiting room was stinking and overcrowded without air conditioning.

railways,Negative,As a terminal you can just have seats at the entrance but at the platforms you won't find any bench to seat upon. Also many coach indicators are not working as well. Still the staffs have maintained a tidy railway station. The Urban Local Line is just adjacent to the Main Express line. Your taxis fare saves there

Hospital,Positive,"I am told that they take good care when patients are admitted, however the diagnosis and admission process take quite a long time. I loved the architecture of the hospital which was built by the British. A beautiful landmark that must be preserved and showcased to the world. Take a look of the pictures and decide for yourself."
Hospital,Negative,"My own experience. Waste of time you you would end up saying better we die than visit this place for treatment. lack of services , doctor are not bothered about patients and clueless some time what to do. No proper management, larger the queue for simple things like getting blood test done atleast needs to stand hours in 5 different queues and it finally gets into delay and delay in everything , adminstration sucks, n time sense and nursing staff and staff always behave rudely and keep asking money from security to dactors this is same."

Hospital,Negative,"Very very bad behaviour by the staffs. Today I had very bad experience in disability ward. I went to apply udid card for my son. I don't now local language so the person whom I met for the further process in disability ward, asked me to get out bcoz of the language issue. He don't know English n Hindi how dare he spoke with a lady with indecent manner. Very very worst staff worst doctor's.plz do some changes its request from the government of Karnataka by the common person"

Surabhi"
Hospital,Negative,"Some staffs are very very rude, loud and doesn't care to help. Some are always angry, no patience. There are few good staffs too. I approach one staff and asked for room no. 27, and she looked at my opd book and ask me to go to the surgeon. I said that I have just met the surgeon and she is the one who asked me to go to room 27. But she doesn't care to listen what I have to say. Instead, she harshly said, ""Go to the surgeon"". Such a cruel staff she was. If one don't want to serve the people or help the patient then better leave the job. I believe they are appointed to help the people not show their anger. Hope they understand and be a little kinder. It's a big hospital and sometimes things get difficult for new timers and non Kannadian speaking people."
Hospital,Negative,We came to the new building for registration for gasto Dr the receptionist was very rude to give change I think her name Ms manu shree we come with the pain her behaviour. ladies were busy with talking gossip i think she is not fit for that palace

Hospital,Negative,"Treatment is good, but no higiene in ICU floor is sticky helpers are so arrogant what see today is felt bad asking directly bribe here with attenders they quarrel no courtesy only (ayas) got admitted in ICU full bed wet"
Hospital,Negative,One of the worst and pathetic hospital in Bangalore. Staffs are behaving rude.and once u admitted in hospital then u have run 100 times for 100 reports . And for reports u have to wait for whole day . And security will ask money to allow the inside the hospital. They will not bother about patient . Because of there negligence i lost my mom ü•∫. If u want to ur parents alive then please don't come here . They will kill them.
Hospital,Negative,All doctors don't know if they are really committed to their work nobody cares for the patients they show that u will be fully recovered in the tecc building but once u r shifted to mpd building or their wards nobody cares . All jnr doctors directly say it out we don't know anything as we don't have any updates and move on
Hospital,Negative,"The biggest joke here is for consultation 10rs is charged, but for a 2 wheeler vehicle parking, they ask 20rs.Worst payment system, patients end up waiting in queue for many many hours."

They also charging rs 50 for polio drop which one is also a free supply from government.Form free supply govt medicine and vaccine also they make it a source of side income.Most importantly though it is a govt hospital but it opens after 10:15 am and remains close on Sundays.
Hospital,Negative,"Horrible place, highly irresponsible staff, pathetic staff attitude. They never give the COVID test result. It has been 2 weeks since I took the test. This is a very callous attitude from the staff. They never bother to give the report. What is the point of taking the COVID test then? The patient may even die before seeking treatment. Let them stop doing the test then. Also, staff comes there only by 10:30 am to 11 am."
Hospital,Positive,The service is quick incase you want covid vaccine. The person at the counter is quick bit functionally answers everything you need. Most of the negative stars are due to unfair expectations from a UPHC.
Hospital,Positive,Hospital was neat and tidy. There was a reception to attend for enquiries. A lady doctor is available for consultation at 11am. One with a ration card can avail free treatment else will be charged accordingly. Located in good proximity for public. Good refrigeration facility available for preserving Vaccines.

I had a servere symptoms so I did the test again yesterday morning in the private hospital my report came today within 24 hours and its positive. Please do not be fool to take the test from this hospital otherwise you will risk your life. Do take care
Hospital,Negative,They don't deserve 1 star too. I went to check-up and get vaccine (which is not sure expired or not) and they gave me calcium and iron for my 6th month pregnancy which is actually already expired this hospital is not safe for especially the person who can't read. Who knows? Maybe they are given expired medicine and vaccine too so careless.
Hospital,Negative,"Funny one. I have book appointment for covaxin vaccine in the cowin portal. However, after going for vaccination at the specified time slot, the staff told me that there is nothing about appointment. One has to come at 8.00am in the morning by taking a token and stand in queue."
Hospital,Negative,First of all neither counsellor not MLA are serious in having regular check to what time the hospital opens. Google says 6am but they are so lazy that they open at 9:00am.
Hospital,Negative,They took too much time to register.Went back to sample collection place and guy collecting samples just touched the tongue and inside of nose and said done . We were sure this sample won't give result and after 3 days result came negative. But at another place same person gave sample and thia time result was positive.

Hospital,Positive,"This is in fact a civil hospital. But right now due to Covid situation has turned into Covid-19 Testing center. Staff are very helpful. Not only staff, at this time, you will find volunteers. Special mention goes to Vinita Kaul mam. A selfless lady, always eager to help. Ready to listen. Not only me, I saw her taking extra care of elderly and all other guys. Doesn't matter whether you are rich or poor. Generally people tend to ignore labour class. She would be first one to reach out to every individual and will try to help them. Chances are if you are stuck on anything, pls ask for Vinita mam. And she will get it done in a jaffa"
Hospital,Negative,"I visited this hospital with rigorous toe-thumb join pain.. Doctor provided medicine without checking the problem. He provided RANTIDINE TABLETS I.P 150 mg, which is banned in UK, US and India due to the contents of Cancer causing substances."
Hospital,Positive,"I walked in today for my second dose of Vaccine....covishield the sister injected but even still now have a question....that did she really injected the dose since I don't have pain I cannot feel the medicine, no bulg or swelling even in the injected area which happens in the first hour"

Hospital,Positive,Good for quick medical assistance for minor problems
Hospital,Negative,Most wasted doctors
Hospital,Positive,"This is a general hospital which previously was a medical college. They have maintained the vintage feel very well. The whole place is so calm. No noises of a hospital. Most of the area are currently under renovation but things happen smooth here. A fumigation is a must as soon as possible. I was here for 2-3 days with my sister's delivery. Mosquitos at this place eats you alive. The hospital staff call them ""pets"" and all and its absolutely not funny. Even my new born niece was bitten by them"
Hospital,Negative,"I'm not sure how to review a government hospital.Calicut Beach Hospital, located near Kozhikode Beach, may be one of the best hospitals in Kozhikode that provides good treatment. However, even though the treatment is good, there will always be a crowd at the OP ticket counter, making you want to wait longer. On my last visit, there was only one staff to deal with the entire crowd, which was disgusting and disappointing . I had an X-ray scan for ‚Çπ120 at a pharmacy after a morning that was extremely full and an evening that was equally congested."
Hospital,Negative,"I had a very disappointing experience at Calicut Beach Hospital. The service was subpar and did not meet my expectations.

Hospital,Positive,"Established in 1951 as a Medical College, the hospital was changed to Govt. General Hospital in 1957. Spread over 12.57 hectares of land, the building consists of 500 beds, 23 general wards and a pay ward. The hospital has almost all departments and is easily accessible as it is located in the head of the city."
Hospital,Negative,"Very bad experience with surgery department. Docters doesn't have time for communication with patient. Dr. Sheeba she behaves very rude.they doesn't consider patient's rights, doesn't feel any respect. So we went to another hospital and done the treatment successfully."
Hospital,Negative,"Don't even try to come on evening....such a worst behaviour of staffs....even it is not crowded, it will take atleast 2hours to see doctor.....better to go to private hospitals"
Hospital,Negative,"No medicine in pharmacy , otherwise doctors are excellent, we can't contact them through phone calls"
Hospital,Negative,"I visited the dental department. There are good doctors. The area was crowded with patients. Due to the rush, i got appointment for cleaning after 2 months. So i had to do it from another private clinic. Doctors are really struggling handling the rush. Treatment charges are low. But getting an appointment is not easy."
Hospital,Positive,"One of the important and famous hospital in Kozhikode city. Generally known as Beach Hospital.

Hospital,Positive,Very clean and well maintained hospital. One of the oldest hospitals in Calicut. Great doctors and friendly staff. Ample parking. Sign boards everywhere to direct patients and visitors. Has a seperate wing for Covid19 treatment.
Hospital,Negative,"The facility is a huge maze with little to no proper signage to guide visitors. While the facility is mostly clean and the washrooms are better than most public toilets, the management deserves credit for this. The strict cleanliness standards are maintained because the staff and security are diligent in enforcing them."
Hospital,Negative,Very bad experience. I have never seen this type of hospital. We admitted my grandmother for face swelling issues on Wednesday. Friday early morning her pulse rate is very low morning at 6.00 am they tell us she died...¬† After she die they not tell anything properly.

park,Positive,"this is a natural reserve which is managed in a good and sustainable way. the visit consists essentially in a 90min boat trip around the lake. it is a good idea to be silent (everyone on the boat) so the animals are not chased away. the park guides do photos with binoculars and your phone if you are interested. the animals are hard to spot to the untrained eye. we got kingfishers, turtles, comorans, bee hives and wild deer on photo. the park is muuuch larger than the lake, any private hiking is strictly forbidden. beware of the gibbons, they will steal your sandwich or bag in no time. why one star less? more help with spotting the animals could be given (we had our own very helpful guide), maybe a TV screen coupled to a live cam with teleobjective (plus text) on the boat, oriented by one of the rangers, could be a help. or systematic binoculars for a small fee."
