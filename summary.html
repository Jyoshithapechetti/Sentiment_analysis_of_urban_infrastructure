            <h2>Hospital</h2>
            <p>I visited Calicut Beach Hospital in Kozhikode, India, for a second time. I had an X-ray scan for IVF and IDF. The hospital is one of the best hospitals in the world and a great place to get treatment.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Metro</h2>
            <p>Bangalore Metro is safe but too crowded. The crowd is not fast, cost-efficient, and somewhat clean. It was good, efficient, and fast. I feel it is comfortable, safe, and cost-effective, though the timing could be improved.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Public Trains</h2>
            <p>Facilities are small in number but useful, like a bathroom and kitchen. The seats are not comfortable, and there is a rush, but it is reasonably priced. General class lacks hygiene and safety, with poorly maintained toilets.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Roads</h2>
            <p>India's national highway network has transformed, but NHAI has some of the worst highways in the world. While India is a cosmopolitan country, it lacks infrastructure. It’s disappointing that the government hasn’t prioritized repairs.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Schools</h2>
            <p>Nadakkav School provides a nurturing environment with skilled teachers, a well-maintained campus, excellent staff, and a high standard of education.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Toilets</h2>
            <p>Public toilets are often unhygienic and poorly maintained. They need significant improvement in cleanliness and maintenance, as they are smelly and moderately clean in most cases.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Water Supply</h2>
            <p>Water shortage is a reality in Indian cities, including Bangalore. The U.S. also faces water crises, with toxic Yamuna water in Delhi and concerns in Rajasthan’s capital and Hyderabad.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Sewage System</h2>
            <p>Sewage systems in cities are outdated, causing frequent overflows. Investments in modern infrastructure and public-private partnerships are essential to prevent river and lake pollution.</p>
